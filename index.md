## Welcome to the 'kinisis DSS' RSS newsfeed

The site serves as a window to the 'kinisis DSS' news about the progress made on the deployment of the platform, and on traffic/infrastructure-related news for Cyprus.  

The site includes an RSS/Atom newsfeed for the 'kinisis' Decision Support System, currently in development. The platform collects, processes and archives (providing chronological and spatial access) to urban mobility, urban-infrastructure conditon assessment, air-quality and metereology data in Cyprus, providing several dashboards and APIs.

The RSS feed is provided through a semi-automativally generated .xml file, containing project-related and platform-related news.
